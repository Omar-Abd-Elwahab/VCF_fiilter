# VCF_filter
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for the development and analysis of a deep-learning model for filtering genomic variants from VCFs. The model can be accessed at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L_g9KWxBbYi7WfUr4-jgabfVmvu3Vjf2?usp=sharing. It includes the necessary code for data preparation and validation sets for testing the final model.
The model is based on TRANSFORMERS with inner workings and structure differences. 
We added words to the vocabulary list that are variant calling related. 
The hyperparameters, including optimizers, activation function, dropout rate, etc., were tuned and optimized until the model performed best.
