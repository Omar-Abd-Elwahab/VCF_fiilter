# VCF_filter
This project is a deep learning model aiming to filter VCF files. There are three models so far: SNPs model, INDELs model, and mixed model. 
The model is based on TRANSFORMERS with differences in the inner working and structure. 
We have 6 layers with 6 neural networks inside each layer. We added words to the vocabulary list.
